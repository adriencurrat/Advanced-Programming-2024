## Introduction
EcoWardrobe is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application developed using Python's Tkinter and a SQLite database. It simulates a digital clothing library where users can browse inventory, rent and return items, and report loss/damage. The app also includes a statistics dashboard and an “Eco-Comparator” that visualizes estimated CO₂ and water savings from renting instead of buying, supporting a circular-economy use case.

## Libraries to Download
To run EcoWardrobe, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- **Tkinter:** For creating the graphical user interface.
- **ttkbootstrap:** For enhancing the appearance of Tkinter widgets.
- **Pillow:** For handling and manipulating images.
- **os:** For interacting with the operating system.
- **random:** For generating random values.
- **sqlite3:** For managing the SQLite database.
- **matplotlib:** For generating graphs and charts.
