## Introduction
EcoWardrobe is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application developed using Python's Tkinter and a SQLite database. It simulates a digital clothing library where users can browse inventory, rent and return items, and report loss/damage. The app also includes a statistics dashboard and an “Eco-Comparator” that visualizes estimated CO₂ and water savings from renting instead of buying, supporting a circular-economy use case.

## Technical overview
This project combines basic Python programming concepts with advanced techniques to develop a user-friendly clothing library application.

- **Python GUI application** built with Tkinter, handling multi-window user interactions (rentals, returns, damage reporting).
- **SQLite database** of 500 clothing items created to store information about the clothing inventory, rentals, and returns.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** structure with dedicated classes for inventory management, transactions, statistics, and user interface logic.
- **Matplotlib** used to generate descriptive statistics and visual charts embedded directly into the application.
