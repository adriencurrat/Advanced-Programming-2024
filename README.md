# Advanced-Programming-2024

## Introduction
EcoWardrobe is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application created with Pythonâ€™s Tkinter, designed to enable users to borrow and return clothing items from a digital clothing library. The library offers a wide selection of garments for both men and women, available in various sizes and price ranges. By offering an alternative to fast fashion, EcoWardrobe supports a circular economy and aims to reduce textile waste. The intuitive interface allows users to rent items, enjoy them for as long as needed, and return them. The inventory status is updated in real-time whenever an item is rented or returned. This project highlights the significance of sustainability in the fashion industry, promoting responsible consumption and the reuse of garments.

- **Eco-Comparator:** Compares the environmental impact of renting versus buying clothing items.
- **Rental:** Manages the process of renting items.
- **Return:** Manages the process of returning items.
