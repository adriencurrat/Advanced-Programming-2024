# EcoWardrobe: A Clothing Library Platform

**Author:** Adrien Currat  
**Institution:** University of Lausanne, Msc. in Economics  
**Course:** Advanced Programming

## Introduction
EcoWardrobe is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application developed using Python's Tkinter and a SQLite database. It simulates a digital clothing library where users can browse inventory, rent and return items, and report loss/damage. The app also includes a statistics dashboard and an “Eco-Comparator” that visualizes estimated CO₂ and water savings from renting instead of buying, supporting a circular-economy use case.

## Skills developed
This project demonstrates applied Python programming skills, including:

- Development of a complete graphical user interface with multiple windows and user interactions (**Tkinter**).
- Creation and management of a database to store inventory, rental status and transactions (**SQLite**).
- Generation of descriptive statistics and visual charts embedded directly into the application (**Matplotlib**).
- Simulating realistic datasets for testing and demonstration purposes. 

## Content of the folder
Clothing_Library.py : This is the main Python script used to run the EcoWardrobe application. It contains all the necessary code to start the GUI, manage rentals and returns, and interact with the SQLite database.

Images Folder: This folder contains all the images used in the application. Ensure you update the file paths for the images in the application to match the paths on your local system
