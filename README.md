## Introduction
EcoWardrobe is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application developed using Python's Tkinter and a SQLite database. It simulates a digital clothing library where users can browse inventory, rent and return items, and report loss/damage. The app also includes a statistics dashboard and an “Eco-Comparator” that visualizes estimated CO₂ and water savings from renting instead of buying, supporting a circular-economy use case.

## Technical overview
This project combines basic Python programming concepts with advanced techniques to develop a user-friendly clothing library application.

- Core Python constructs such as **branching**, **loops**, **functions**, and **lists** are extensively used throughout the code. Two global lists facilitate the passing of information about items between different classes.
- A **SQLite database** of 500 clothing items is created to store detailed information about the clothing inventory, rentals, and returns.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is central to the project’s structure, ensuring the code is organised and easy to maintain. Several classes are defined, each responsible for a distinct part of the application. **Encapsulation** groups related data and methods within these classes, while **Inheritance** allows classes to reuse code from parent classes. 
- **Matplotlib** is used to generate descriptive statistics and visual charts embedded directly into the application.
